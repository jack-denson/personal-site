# Jack Denson's Personal Website

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This project was made with the intention of learning how to deploy, using a service like AWS, Heroku, Firebase, or something else.

Ended up being deployed using AWS Amplify, a service that connects to this repository to allow for CD

Connected with Google Domains, to live at www.jdenson.com

Next steps: add more content to the site, fix mobile display for projects selector, and more.
