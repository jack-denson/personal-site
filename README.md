This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This project was made with the intention of learning how to deploy, using a service like AWS, Heroku, Firebase, or something else.

Is served through a simple Express backend.

Static build in the build folder, edited files in the rest.
