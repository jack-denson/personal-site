This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This project was made with the intention of learning how to deploy, using a service like AWS, Heroku, Firebase, or something else.

Currently only has a front end, next step may be to build a simple backend Node/Express server.

Static build in the build folder, edited files in the rest.
